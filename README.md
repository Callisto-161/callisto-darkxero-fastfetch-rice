# callisto-darkxero-fastfetch-rice
Fastfetch rice based on the one found at <a href="https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-layan-git?tab=readme-ov-file">this repository</a>.
I am new to github and was not sure whether to fork the repository or make a new one and link to it, I decided to link to it because the original repository is a fully fledged desktop rice, and this is just for fastfetch.
I originally encountered this rice from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GarudaLinux/comments/1dcq0dl/making_fastfetch_more_beautiful_linux/">this</a>
post on reddit. I have tweaked the layout and appearance a bit, and added a custom logo. The text "Fedora Linux" is a modified version of the ASCII font "5 Line Oblique" found at <a href="https://www.asciiart.eu/text-to-ascii-art">this</a> wonderful little webtool. The text "kde plasma" is a modified version of the font "cursive" found at this <a href="http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Cursive&t=kde%20plasma">other wonderful little webtool</a>. The look of this rice was partly inspired by the text at the top of <a href="https://sinewave.cyou/index.html">this</a> website.

It was through the help of reddit user u/Long-Squirrel6407, who reccomended me <a href="https://websim.ai/p/qqnmanhuzb6x49_ic33e">yet another cool webtool</a>, that I was able figure out how to colour in the custom ASCII logo.

Also, forgot to mention, the font I'm using is <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads">Iosevka Nerd Font</a>, and I would recommend you use it too if you want this to look good. If you want a different font I would reccomend at least sticking with nerd fonts so that the icons show up correctly.
